# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Tech utilized
- Pics

**Intro**

This project shows all of the places my family and I have traveled to around the U.S. Users can replace the images with their own and change the card titles.

**Figma**

- The tech utilized was Figma and Visual Studio Code. I used the inspect function on my computer to make sure the visual product matched the Figma design.

**Images**

If you want to upload your own images, download them from your figma or local folder and then optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project functions properly.

I truly hope you enjoy making your own virtual memories as much as I did!
